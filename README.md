## My process

For this project, I started by creating the sections I thought I would need to organize the content and then styled it. 

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Since this is my first FrontEnd Mentor project, I am learning more about the process than about new HTML and CSS 

### Continued development

I am new to website development, so I am hoping to get better at my workflow and general knowledge. 

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Help](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with flexbox. I am sure everyone already uses this website.
